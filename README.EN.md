<h3 align="center">todo-list app</h3>

  - A small demo of to-do items implemented using Vue3.0 + koa2 + MongoDB
  - The page design refers to [limni-todo](https://github.com/lizzz0523/limni/tree/master/todo-app) this project, I used vue3.0 to refactor all
  - I came into contact with koa2 and MongoDB through the blog, so I learned koa2 and MongoDB databases, wrote the backend with koa2, and supported the homepage login verification function. Although only the backend part of the login interface is currently done, it can be considered a small implementation. Separation of front and back ends ðŸ˜€, the subsequent development of the back-end of the todo-list page is planned to realize the operation of connecting to the database
